The Couchbase Operator can be used to instantly deploy the Autonomous Operator, Admission Controller, and Couchbase Cluster.
Additonally, Sync Gateway can be deployed, along with auto-generation of TLS and networking services.

To quickly deploy the admission controller and Operator, as well as a
Couchbase Server cluster:

        helm repo add couchbase https://couchbase-partners.github.io/helm-charts/
        helm repo update

2.  Install the Chart:

        helm install default couchbase/couchbase-operator
